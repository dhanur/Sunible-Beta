that a court can award.  Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is

send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal
Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical
address on file for you, by electronic mail (&quot;<b>Notice</b>&quot;).  Sunible's
address for Notice is: Sunible Inc.  55 Harrison Street, 3<sup>rd</sup> Floor,
Oakland, CA 94607.  The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the
claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (&quot;<b>Demand</b>&quot;).
We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do
not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received,
you or Sunible may commence an arbitration proceeding.  During the arbitration,
the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Sunible shall not be
disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision
and award, if any.    In the event our dispute is finally resolved through
arbitration in your favor, Sunible shall pay you (i) the amount awarded by the
arbitrator, if any, (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Sunible
in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award; or (iii)
$1,000.00, whichever is greater.</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt'>.  In the event that you commence arbitration in
accordance with these Terms, Sunible will reimburse you for your payment of the
filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the
payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules.  Any arbitration hearings
will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Alameda County, California,
provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the
arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to
the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or
(iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules</span> <span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>in the county (or parish) of your billing address.    If
the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief
sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as
measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)),
then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.  In such case,
you agree to reimburse Sunible for all monies previously disbursed by it that
are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules.  Regardless of the
manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a
reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and
conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.  The arbitrator
may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of
fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either
party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.</span></p>

style='font-size:11.0pt'>. In the interest of resolving disputes between you
and Sunible in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Sunible
agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms shall be
resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in
court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may
allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very
limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief
that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is
not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms,
whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other
legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the
termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO
THESE TERMS, YOU AND Sunible ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR
TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</span></p>

send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal

address for Notice is: Sunible Inc. 55 Harrison Street, 3<sup>rd</sup> Floor,
Oakland, CA 94607. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the
claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (&quot;<b>Demand</b>&quot;).
We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do
not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received,
you or Sunible may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration,
the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Sunible shall not be

  <div>Sunible is the easiest way for homeowners to go solar. We are on a mission to lower America's electricity bills, with energy that is falling free from the sky!<br><br>You wouldn't buy flight tickets, insurance or a phone plan without understanding and comparing all your options. Sunible will help you do the same thing with solar, and then some. We will help you understand if solar can work for your home (yep, if it doesn't, we will be upfront about it). We will also help you select the best provider possible, and answer just about any question you have along the way. No charge!

  <li><a><b>What happens after I register?</b></a>
  <div>First, we will call you to get a few more details about your home, and to make sure you're a real person (and not a web bot, zombie or the boogie man!). We will then share this information with the solar providers you chose, and follow up with them until you get your quotes.
  <br><br>Team Sunible will be in touch with you along the way to answer any questions. Once you make your decision and get those man-made miracles installed on your roof, we will ask you to rate your experience. This will help more people in your neighborhood, your city and the rest of America go solar, one rooftop at a time.

  <li><a><b>What do the PREMIUM, STANDARD and VALUE price categories mean?</b></a>
  <div>PREMIUM providers typically offer high-output solar panels (that use less space on your roof), highly customized installations (eg. if you have a non-standard roof) and sophisticated monitoring systems (to view energy-use and savings in real-time). They also provide great payment plans. These providers fall in the top 33% of all providers, in terms of average cost of systems installed in your area.
  <br><br>STANDARD providers typically offer industry-standard solar panels, equipment and payment plans.  This group falls in the middle 33% of all providers, in terms of average cost of systems installed in your area.
  <br><br>VALUE providers also offer industry-standard solar panels and equipment, and fall in the bottom 33% in terms of average cost of systems installed in your area. These providers may offer a limited choice of payment plans.

  <div>There are two main ways, Ownership and Solar-as-a-service.
  <br><br>Ownership is like buying a car, but with free gas, forever. And just like you would with a car, you can buy your solar system with cash upfront or through a low-cost solar loan.

  <div>With ownership, you benefit from a lot more savings. This is because you get a 30% federal tax credit (and possibly other state, county and city incentives). Solar ownership also increases your property value. The system pays for itself in a few years or longer, depending on how big it is and how you finance it. Because of the low cost of solar and generous incentives, the payback is much quicker than it used to be.

  <br><br>Depending on which city you live in, you will either pay a monthly fee (that is lower than your current power bill) or for just the power you use (which will also be lower than your current power prices).

  <div>Solar panels are simple, durable, inexpensive semiconductors with no moving parts. Translation: they are built to last for decades.. in the rain, snow and of course.. the sun. Solar panels installed in the '70s are still generating power, and have been used to power satellites for even longer!

  <li><a><b>Can I get all my power from solar?</b></a>
  <div>That depends on how much power you use and how big your roof is. Your solar system will still be connected to the grid. When you're generating more power than you use, the excess goes back to the grid and your meter runs backwards. You get a credit from your utility for that power, so you can use it when your system is not generating electricity - like at night.

  <li><a><b>Shouldn't I wait till solar technology improves?</b></a>
  <div>Glad you asked! The answer is no, for three reasons.
  <br><br>AReason #1, the biggest technology advancements have already happened over the last decade. Reason #2, waiting to go solar would just delay your savings. Going solar now guarantees savings on your power bill, and increases those savings further as power prices rise. And Reason #3, there are some great rebates and incentives in place today to encourage clean energy adoption. These incentives won't go on indefinitely, and some are already ending. Bonus Reason #4, we could all do with a little less of ol' King CONG (Coal, Oil, Nuclear, Gas).
