</span></span><b><span style='font-size:11.0pt'>Fees</span></b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>. In the event that you commence arbitration in
accordance with these Terms, Sunible will reimburse you for your payment of the
filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the
payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings
will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Alameda County, California,
provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the
arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to
the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or
(iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules</span> <span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>in the county (or parish) of your billing address.  If
the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief
sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as
measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)),
then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case,
you agree to reimburse Sunible for all monies previously disbursed by it that
are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the
manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a
reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and
conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator
may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of
fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either
party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.</span></p>

consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over
any form of a representative or class proceeding.</span></p>
