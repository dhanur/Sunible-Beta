  <li><a><b>What is Sunible?</b></a>
  <div>Sunible is the easiest way for homeowners to go solar. We are on a mission to lower America's electricity bills, with energy that is falling free from the sky!<br><br>You wouldn't buy flight tickets, insurance or a phone plan without understanding and comparing all your options. Sunible will help you do the same thing with solar, and then some. We will help you understand if solar can work for your home (yep, if it doesn't, we will be upfront about it). We will also help you select the best installer possible, and answer just about any question you have along the way. No charge!

  <ul id="faq"> 
  <li><a><b>What happens after I register?</b></a>
  <div>First, we will call you to get a few more details about your home, and to make sure you're a real person (and not a web bot, zombie or the boogie man!). We will then share this information with the solar installers you chose, and follow up with them until you get your quotes.
  <br><br>Team Sunible will be in touch with you along the way to answer any questions. Once you make your decision and get those man-made miracles installed on your roof, we will ask you to rate your experience. This will help more people in your neighborhood, your city and the rest of America go solar, one rooftop at a time.

  <ul id="faq">
  <li><a><b>What do the PREMIUM, STANDARD and VALUE price categories mean?</b></a>
  <div>PREMIUM installers typically offer high-output solar panels (that use less space on your roof), highly customized installations (eg. if you have a non-standard roof) and sophisticated monitoring systems (to view energy-use and savings in real-time). They also provide great payment plans. These installers fall in the top 33% of all installers, in terms of average cost of systems installed in your area.
  <br><br>STANDARD installers typically offer industry-standard solar panels, equipment and payment plans.  This group falls in the middle 33% of all installers, in terms of average cost of systems installed in your area.
  <br><br>VALUE installers also offer industry-standard solar panels and equipment, and fall in the bottom 33% in terms of average cost of systems installed in your area. These installers may offer a limited choice of payment plans.

  <ul id="faq"> 
  <li><a><b>So what is better - PREMIUM, STANDARD or VALUE?</b></a>
  <div>There isn't one that is better, because each category offers distinct benefits. We think it's best to compare VALUE installers with other VALUE installers, based on Homes Installed and Yelp Ratings. Likewise for STANDARD and PREMIUM.

  <li><a><b>Isn't solar expensive?</b></a>
  <div>Not any more. The price of a solar panel has plummeted from 5 dollars per watt a few years ago to less than 50 cents today. Technology standardization and mass-adoption has done to solar what it did to laptops and cell phones.

  <ul id="faq"> 
  <li><a><b>So, how do I save money with solar?</b></a>
  <div>You save money by paying less for solar power than you pay now for ''regular'' power. While the price of solar power is falling, the price of grid power has and will continue to rise.

  <ul id="faq">
  <li><a><b>How do I pay for solar?</b></a>
  <div>There are two main ways, Ownership and Solar-as-a-service.
  <br><br>Ownership is like buying a car, but with free gas, forever. And just like you would with a car, you can buy your solar system with cash upfront or through a low-cost solar loan. Solar-as-a-service is like a phone plan. It allows you to go solar with little to no upfront cost, and delivers savings from day 1.

  <ul id="faq"> 
  <li><a><b>What is the benefit of Ownership?</b></a>
  <div>With ownership, you benefit from a lot more savings. This is because you get a 30% federal tax credit (and possibly other state, county and city incentives). Solar ownership also increases your property value. The system pays for itself in a few years or longer, depending on how big it is and how you finance it. Because of the low cost of solar and generous incentives, the payback is much quicker than it used to be.
  <br><br>If you can afford the upfront cost, Ownership is always the better choice.

  <li><a><b>What is the benefit of Solar-as-a-service?</b></a>
  <div>With Solar-as-a-service, you can go solar with little or no upfront cost and start saving money from day one. The solar panels will still be on your roof, but are owned and maintained (for free) by someone else.
  <br><br>Depending on which city you live in, you will either pay a monthly fee (that is lower than your current power bill) or for just the power you use (which will also be lower than your current power prices). Over 50% of solar homes in the U.S. chose Solar-as-a-service, presumably because it is quick, convenient and offers immediate savings.

  <li><a><b>Do I need a big roof? Does it have to face South?</b></a>
  <div>How much space you need depends on how much electricity you use. As long as your roof is not shaded, it does not have to face south. But you don't need to figure all this out yourself, your chosen installer will make this assessment for free.

  <li><a><b>What if I live in an area without a lot of sun?</b></a>
  <div>Not a problem! Sunshine is a factor, but not the most important one. Unless your roof is shaded, you can still generate plenty of power from the sun. You can even go solar if you live in an area where it snows a lot.
  <br><br>Don't believe us? Look at Germany! They get a lot less sun than we do, yet there are more solar homes there than anywhere else in the world. Still don't believe us? Look at New Jersey, Massachusetts and Delaware..  they are some of our leading solar states, and they're not exactly sunshine states :)

  <li><a><b>Will solar panels damage my roof? What if I need to fix or replace my roof later?</b></a>
  <div>Before putting any panels on, your solar installers will verify that your roof is in good enough shape. Solar panels can actually protect your roof from wear and tear. And whether you choose Ownership or Solar-as-a-service, all equipment comes with long-term warranties.

  <ul id="faq"> 
  <li><a><b>How long do these things last? And do they require a lot of maintenance?</b></a>
  <div>Solar panels are simple, durable, inexpensive semiconductors with no moving parts. Translation: they are built to last for decades.. in the rain, snow and of course.. the sun. Solar panels installed in the '70s are still generating power, and have been used to power satellites for even longer!
  <br><br>And whether you choose Ownership or Solar-as-a-service, most solar systems come with 25-year warranties.

  <ul id="faq"> 
  <li><a><b>Can I get all my power from solar?</b></a>
  <div>That depends on how much power you use and how big your roof is. Your solar system will still be connected to the grid. When you're generating more power than you use, the excess goes back to the grid and your meter runs backwards. You get a credit from your utility for that power, so you can use it when your system is not generating electricity - like at night.

  <ul id="faq"> 
  <li><a><b>Shouldn't I wait till solar technology improves?</b></a>
  <div>Glad you asked! The answer is no, for three reasons.
  <br><br>AReason #1, the biggest technology advancements have already happened over the last decade. Reason #2, waiting to go solar would just delay your savings. Going solar now guarantees savings on your power bill, and increases those savings further as power prices rise. And Reason #3, there are some great rebates and incentives in place today to encourage clean energy adoption. These incentives won't go on indefinitely, and some are already ending. Bonus Reason #4, we could all do with a little less of ol' King CONG (Coal, Oil, Nuclear, Gas).
